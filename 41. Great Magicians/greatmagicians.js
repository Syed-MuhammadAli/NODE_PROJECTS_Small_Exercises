// Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.
var magicians = ["Harry Houdini", "David Blaine", "Teller"];
var show_magicians = function (magicians) {
    for (var _i = 0, magicians_1 = magicians; _i < magicians_1.length; _i++) {
        var magician = magicians_1[_i];

    }
};
var make_great = function (magicians) {
    for (var i = 0; i < magicians.length; i++) {
        console.log(magicians[i]);
        magicians[i] = "The Great ".concat(magicians[i]);
